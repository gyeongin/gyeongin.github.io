I am a PhD student at Seoul National University (SNU), advised by [Prof. Byung-Gon Chun](https://bgchun.wordpress.com/). My research interest lies in the intersection of computer systems and machine learning, with a focus on systems for machine learning. More specifically, I am primarily working on software techniques to improve machine learning in the datacenter, including both inference and training.

I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering (CSE) and economics from SNU in 2017.
